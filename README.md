# Multi-state occupacy model for systemic disease

In case of systemic infectious  diseases a pathogen can affect multiple tissues and multiple organs at the same time or in a sequence as the infection progresses. In such cases, particulalry when we are sampling wildlife for pathogen, or doing mass surveillence, infection prevalence depends on which tissue is tested. 
Addtitionally, depending on the sensitivity of the test, a pathogen can go undetected even when it was present. In this paper published in Journal of Applied Ecology, we explored these challenges for an infectious pathogen of wildlife which impacts multiple tissues- Pseudorabies virus (PrV). PrV affects a variety of vulnerable wildlife including endagered Florida panthers.
We developed a version of widely used species distribution model that accounts for imperfect detection, various covariates that may influence infection and treat latent infection process as dependent or independent on the infection of neigboring tissues.
